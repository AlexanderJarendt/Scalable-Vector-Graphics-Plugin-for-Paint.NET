SvgFileType
===========

This is a Paint.NET filetype plugin for loading SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and its compressed variant SVGZ files. 

The plugin is a tiny wrapper around the [SVG.NET Library](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG) which does the actual SVG reading.

Please check the Releases section for binary download.

To install the plugin perform the following steps:
 * Put the DLL in the <Paint.NET>/FileTypes directory (default location is C:\Program Files\paint.net\FileTypes)
 * Restart Paint.NET if you have it open
